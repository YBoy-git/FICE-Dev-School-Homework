## How to run

### **Prerequisites**

You should have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and should be able to press buttons on your keyboard. Also, you have to know how to run commands in a terminal.

### Running
1. Get the code. This can be done in several ways:
  - clone the repository;
  - clone the code into `.js` file.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the file using `cd` or your GUI. I'm not going to write a step-by-step guide on this.
3. Run `node <filename>`.
  > example: `node yboyi-1.js`

> [!NOTE]
> There is no UI in programs, so, essentially, you will not see anything helpful.
>
> You should either write UI or write your test cases manually.
